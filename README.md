# pilotapp

 Embedded app for pilot to interact with boat electrical systems - runs on a RPi 4 + touchscreen.


# CMakeLists.config.txt

Before doing anything, make sure to create a new file called `CMakeLists.config.txt` in the same directory as `CMakeLists.txt` with the below template.

```

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9)

# includes all libs
# include_directories("/usr/include")
# link_directories("/usr/lib")
# SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -pthread")

## QT Options
set(QT_INSTALL_PATH "[insert Qt installation path]")
set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "${QT_INSTALL_PATH}")  # <--- MAKE SURE HOMEBREW INSTALLATION FOR QT IS x86_64 (arm is not supported for dependencies)

## ZMQ Options
set(ZMQ_VERSION "4.3.4") # <-- sometimes not needed
set(ZMQ_INSTALL_PATH "[insert ZMQ installation path]")
include_directories("${ZMQ_INSTALL_PATH}/include")
link_directories("${ZMQ_INSTALL_PATH}/lib")

## Boost Options
set(BOOST_INSTALL_PATH "[insert Boost installation path]")
include_directories("${BOOST_INSTALL_PATH}/include")

## QGeoView Options
set(QGEOVIEW_INSTALL_PATH "[insert QGeoView installation path]")
include_directories("${QGEOVIEW_INSTALL_PATH}/include")
link_directories("${QGEOVIEW_INSTALL_PATH}/lib")

## msgpack Options (Sometimes not needed, uses "msgpack-config.cmake" instead of include and lib folders)
# set(MSGPACK_INSTALL_PATH "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/3rd_party/msgpack")
# add_subdirectory("${MSGPACK_INSTALL_PATH}")
# include_directories("${MSGPACK_INSTALL_PATH}/include/msgpack")

######

# NOTE: IF YOU GET AN ERROR ABOUT "Library not loaded" referenced from "libEsriCommonQt.dylib", 
# create a symbolic link between the "Frameworks" folder in the Qt installation folder (QT_INSTALL_PATH)
# and the "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/build" folder generated by CMAKE such that "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/build/Frameworks" exists
# For MacOS, you can do this: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/115648/ 
# (for instance ln -s /usr/local/Homebrew/Cellar/qt@5/5.15.2_2/Frameworks Users/richy/Documents/GitHub/pilotapp/pilotapp/build)

######

set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake" ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH})
set(CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR})

## Set CMAKE Arch to x86_64 [depricated]

#set(CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM x86_64)
#set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR x86_64)
#set(CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES x86_64)

```

This file will include all the CMake configurations specific to your system. Make sure to set the appropriate library paths accordingly.

## Pre-Setup Instructions




### Qt SDK Options

### Visual Studio Installation Options

Check `Desktop Development with C++` with these options.

***Do NOT check SDK 10.0.19041.0 due to a bug***

### Visual Studio Build Tools Installation Options

Check `Desktop Development with C++` with these options.




![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77907654/180627126-96670f5c-65cb-46ec-9574-75ff407a041f.png)




## Environment Variables

Make sure you have the correct paths to VScode bin, CMake bin, and your compiler's bin (MinGW for example). 

In Windows Search bar, type edit the system environment windows -> open it -> Click "Path" and click edit -> add bin paths.

More information in the video below.




### VScode extensions

- CMake Tools

- C/C++

- CMake

- CMake Language Support




## [Windows 11/10 Setup](https://youtu.be/8bXEM16MvEQ)



In the video you will see paths being modified in CMakeLists.txt. Use these in c_cpp_properties.json as well.

Your `settings.json` should look like this. Use Visual Studio as your generator; MinGW Makefiles should be a fallback in case if you have it installed.

```json

{

    "cmake.configureOnOpen": true,

    "cmake.sourceDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}/pilotapp",

    "cmake.cmakePath": "C:/CMake/bin/cmake",

    "cmake.generator": "Visual Studio 17 2022"

}

```
